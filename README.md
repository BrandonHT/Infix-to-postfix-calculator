# Infix to postfix calculator
First project of Data structures course at ITAM developing a calculator using **stacks** and **queues** to convert from infix to postfix notation.

# Problem description
The main objective of this project is to develop a calculator that could perform arithmetic operations using positive and negative real numbers. Also, the calculator should have a friendly graphic interface (GUI) to help the user to use it and prevent from possible errors. The operations to perform are indicated by the user using the **infix** notation with the **addition( + )**, **substraction( - )**, **multiplication( \* )** and **division( \\ )** expressions, as well as the use of parenthesis to perform the operations using the hierarchy of operations.
